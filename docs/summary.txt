For most of my career, which spans 15 years, I was a developer working in newsrooms, helping audiences understand important stories by telling them in compelling ways. As a developer, I’ve been able to combine my passions for storytelling and analyzing complicated datasets. Two years ago I took on a new role, transitioning to manager of the data visuals team at the Texas Tribune, which reaches 3.5 million unique viewers monthly. In this role, I manage a team of developers as they collaborate with reporters to tell nuanced stories. I help team members by giving editorial advice on their projects, walking through technical issues, editing and collaborating with other editors. I do, however, miss the day-to-day of being a developer, getting into the nitty gritty of the code, which is why I’m applying for data developer roles. I'm open to the type of roles and type of organizations, I just want to feel passionate about the work and feel I'm making a difference.
